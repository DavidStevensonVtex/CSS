    Maybe One or Two Fair Uses of !important
<!--     
    One way to use !important is if you have to override a style that cannot be overridden in any other way. 
    This could be if you are working on a Content Management System (CMS) and cannot edit the CSS code. Then 
    you can set some custom styles to override some of the CMS styles.

    Another way to use !important is: Assume you want a special look for all buttons on a page. Here, buttons 
    are styled with a gray background color, white text, and some padding and border: -->
    <style>
        .button {
            background-color: #8c8c8c;
            color: white;
            padding: 5px;
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
