    <h1>The background Property</h1>

    <p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.
    </p>

    <p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

    <p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>
